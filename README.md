## 👨‍💻: About me

For those who have strayed here and don't know me yet, here are a few words about me: I'm Jakob and I'm currently studying geoinformatics at the University of Münster in my bachelor's degree. Here I am especially interested in remote sensing, spatial prediction and location privacy. I also work as a student assistant at IVV5 and help to establish and maintain a functioning IT infrastructure for the employees of the university. Privately, I am involved in machine learning, as well as image processing.

file-managment-ts is a project where I'm trying to develop an internal API to manipulate the filesystem under Linux using Typescript. Currently the interface is based on the "fs" library of Node.js, but the goal is to replace the library with direct Linux system calls and make the project dependency-free.

In this project, I built a web application with four other fellow students that allows spatial predictions to be made using models generated with machine learning. The service allows the training of models based on own training data as well as the computation of predictions based on models and spatially corresponding automatically provided satellite images. The frontend was developed with Angular in Typescript, the backend with a Node.js express server and R scripts for the predictions.

<br>
city-lab is a web application that we developed in a group as part of a study project, the goal was to provide users of urban gardening a tool with which such a garden can be easily managed. In the tool different objects can be created by users, which can be viewed by all users. My main task was the administration of the database structures and the access to them via the javascript framework mongoose.
